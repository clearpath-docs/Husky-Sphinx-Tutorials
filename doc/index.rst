Husky is a rugged, outdoor-ready unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), suitable for research and rapid prototyping applications. Husky fully supports ROSâ€”all of the packages are available in the `Husky github org <https://github.com/husky>`_.

For more information or to receive a quote, please `visit us online <http://clearpathrobotics.com/husky>`_.

.. Warning::
  These tutorials assume that you are comfortable working with ROS.  We recommend starting with our
  `ROS tutorial <./../ros>`_ if you are not familiar with ROS already.

.. note::

  These tutorials specifically target Husky robots running Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic, as it is the standard OS environment for Husky. If instead you have an older Husky robot running Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic, please follow `this tutorial <https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/melodic/melodic-to-noetic/index.html>`_ to upgrade its OS environment to Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic.
