Husky Move Base Demo
========================

This tutorial shows you how to use `move_base <http://wiki.ros.org/move_base>`_ to perform basic autonomous planning and movement on a simulated Husky, or a factory-standard Husky with a laser scanner publishing on the scan topic.

To adapt this demo to your own Husky, you may need to clone the `husky_navigation <http://wiki.ros.org/husky_navigation>`_ repository, and modify the relevant parameters. To learn about `move_base <http://wiki.ros.org/move_base>`_ and the `navigation stack <http://wiki.ros.org/move_base>`_, see the `Navigation Tutorials <http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials>`_.

Instructions
--------------------------

1.  Please make sure that the Husky navigation demo package is installed:

.. code:: bash

	sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-husky-navigation

2.  In three separate terminal windows:

	i.  Start the Clearpath-configured Husky simulation environment:

	.. code:: bash

		roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_playpen.launch

	ii. Start the Clearpath-configured `rviz <http://wiki.ros.org/rviz>`_ visualizer:

	.. code:: bash

		roslaunch husky_viz view_robot.launch

	iii. Start the move_base demo:

	.. code:: bash

		roslaunch husky_navigation move_base_mapless_demo.launch

3.  In the Rviz visualizer, make sure the visualizers in the Navigation group are enabled.

4.  Use the 2D Nav Goal tool in the top toolbar to select a movement goal in the visualizer. Make sure to select an unoccupied (dark grey) or unexplored (light grey) location.

5.  Note that in this example, the robot has no absolute localization source, and the position estimate will drift relative to the world. See the next tutorial for a demo with localization.
