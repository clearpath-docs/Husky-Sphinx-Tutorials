Backing Up Husky Configuration
=================================


Upgrading your Clearpath Husky to ROS Noetic from older ROS distributions is a straightforward process, however it's important to understand that each Husky is different, having undergone customization to your specifications by our robotsmiths.  For more complete upgrade instructions see `this guide <https://clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/kinetic-to-melodic/index.html>`_.

Please take the time to understand what these modifications are, and how to recreate them on your fresh install of Ubuntu Focal/ROS Noetic.

Performing a Backup
-----------------------------


1.  As a fail-safe, please make an image of your robot's hard drive. You should always be able to restore this image if you need to revert back to your previous configuration.

*  The easiest approach may be to either connect a removable (USB or similar) hard drive to the robot PC, or to unplug the robot hard drive and 	insert it into a PC or workstation.
*  You can then use a tool such as CloneZilla or dd to write a backup image of your robot's hard drive onto another hard drive.
*  Alternatively, you can simply replace the robot computer's hard-drive, reserving the Hydro-configured drive and installing a new one to use with Noetic.

2.  There are several places in the filesystem you should specifically look for customizations for your Husky:

===============================================	====================================================
Location:                                       Description:
===============================================	====================================================
``/etc/network/interfaces``                     Your robot may have a custom network configuration configured in this file.
``/etc/ros/*/husky-core.d/*.launch``            Will contain ``base.launch`` and ``description.launch``, may contain custom launch files for your robot configuration.  Replaced by ``ros.d`` in newer versions.
``/etc/ros/*/ros.d/*.launch``                   Will contain ``base.launch`` and ``description.launch``, may contain custom launch files for your robot configuration.  Replaces ``husky-core.d`` in newer versions.
``/etc/ros/setup.bash``                         May contain environment variables for your configuration.

3.   Please save all these files and use them as a reference during Noetic configuration!
